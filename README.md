Product Requirements Document (PRD)
AI-Driven Dietary & Nutrition Assistant

For Hospitality Management (Health-Conscious Meal Personalization)

    Document Overview 1.1 Purpose

This PRD defines the development of an AI-powered dietary assistant that customizes meal recommendations for hotel guests based on their health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, allergies) while integrating with restaurant systems and buffet safety checks.
1.2 Key Objectives

‚úî Automate personalized meal suggestions for guests with dietary restrictions.
‚úî Prevent allergic reactions via real-time ingredient scanning.
‚úî Enhance guest experience through health-conscious dining.
‚úî Ensure compliance with food safety regulations (FDA, EU FIC).
2. Product Scope
2.1 Features & Functionality
Feature	Description	User Benefit
Disease-Specific Menu Suggestions	Recommends meals aligned with dietary needs (e.g., low-sodium for hypertension).	Reduces manual effort in selecting safe foods.
Allergen Detection in Buffets	AI scans buffet items via cameras, flags allergens (e.g., nuts, gluten).	Prevents accidental exposure.
Mobile Alerts	Push notifications to guests if unsafe dishes are detected.	Real-time safety updates.
Chef & Staff Dashboard	Live view of dietary requests (e.g., "Table 4: Vegan, No Soy").	Streamlines kitchen operations.
Integration with Health Apps	Syncs with Apple Health/Google Fit for calorie/nutrition tracking.	Seamless health management.
2.2 Out of Scope

‚ùå Preparing meals (kitchen automation).
‚ùå Medical diagnosis (e.g., glucose monitoring).
‚ùå Handling non-food allergies (e.g., detergent sensitivities).
3. User Stories & Workflows
3.1 Guest Journey

Pre-Arrival/Booking:

    Guest shares dietary needs (e.g., "Celiac disease") via:

        Booking portal (NLP form: "Any food allergies or diets?").

        Mobile app (voice/text input: "I need keto-friendly meals").

At the Restaurant:

    Digital Menu: Highlights suitable dishes (e.g., "Gluten-Free Pasta ‚òÖ").

    Buffet Safety Scan: Camera scans labels; guest receives alert: "Caution: Salad contains sesame!".

Post-Meal Feedback:

    AI asks: "Was your meal safe? Thumbs up/down." to improve recommendations.

3.2 Staff Workflow

Kitchen Display System (KDS): Flags special dietary orders.

AI Alerts: Notifies staff if a guest ignores an allergen warning.

4. Technical Requirements
4.1 Tech Stack
Component	Technology	Purpose
Backend	Python (FastAPI), Node.js	Menu logic, allergy databases.
AI/ML Models	NLP (GPT-4 for parsing requests), CNN (ResNet for food image recognition)	Analyze dietary needs, detect allergens.
Database	Firebase (real-time alerts), PostgreSQL (menu data)	Sync guest preferences.
Frontend	React Native (mobile app), Digital Menu Tablets	Guest/staff interfaces.
APIs	Edamam Nutrition DB, Open Food Facts (allergen data)	Verify ingredients.
Hardware	IP Cameras (buffet), QR Code Scanners	Ingredient tracking.
4.2 Data & Compliance

üîí Encryption: TLS 1.3 for data in transit.
üìú Compliance: FDA Food Code, EU FIC (allergen labeling laws).
üîÑ Data Retention: Delete dietary preferences post-checkout (opt-in for loyalty programs).
5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

üìä Adoption Rate: % of guests using dietary features.
üçΩÔ∏è Meal Customization Requests: Volume of AI-generated suggestions.
‚ö†Ô∏è Allergic Incidents: Reduction in reported cases.
6. Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
False negatives in allergen detection.	Combine AI with manual chef verification for high-risk items (e.g., peanuts).
Guest non-compliance (ignoring alerts).	Staff training to intervene discreetly.
API latency in real-time scanning.	Edge computing (on-premise servers for buffet cameras).
7. Roadmap

Phase 1 (3 months): NLP-based menu recommendations + mobile alerts.
Phase 2 (6 months): Buffet CV integration at 2 pilot hotels.
Phase 3 (12 months): Voice-enabled dietary assistant (e.g., "Alexa, ask the hotel chef if this has dairy").
Approval

Stakeholders:

F&B Director (Menu Integration)

CTO (AI Accuracy Validation)

Legal (Allergen Liability Compliance)

PRD Version: 1.0
Status: Ready for Review

Next Steps:
‚úÖ Partner with allergy advocacy groups for testing.
‚úÖ Train kitchen staff on AI tool protocols.
‚úÖ Conduct stress tests for real-time CV processing.

I've created a comprehensive AI-driven dietary and nutrition assistant that brings your PRD to life with a beautiful, production-worthy implementation. The application demonstrates all the key features you outlined with sophisticated design and functionality.

The system includes three main interfaces - a guest portal for personalized dining experiences, a staff dashboard for kitchen operations and safety monitoring, and an admin panel for analytics and compliance tracking. The AI-powered recommendation engine analyzes guest health profiles to suggest safe meals while providing real-time allergen detection and safety alerts.

Key highlights include the intelligent menu browser that ranks dishes based on individual health conditions, the kitchen display system with allergen alerts for staff, real-time buffet scanning simulation, comprehensive guest health profile management, and detailed analytics for compliance monitoring. The design features a premium hospitality aesthetic with smooth animations, responsive layouts, and intuitive navigation that would work perfectly on hotel tablets and mobile devices.
